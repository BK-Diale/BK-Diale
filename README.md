- 👋 Hi, I’m @BK-Diale An enthusiastic and knowledgeable young person who is able to provide front line and technical support as part of any IT service operation. Ben is a logical thinker who handles 1st/2nd line support calls, analyse and investigate problems, implement fixes, escalate support calls to 2nd/3rd level and work closely with the service desk team. He is flexible, resourceful and willing to take full ownership of user problem until they are fully resolved. He is hungry to learn IT from the ground up, and is currently looking for a suitable position with a forward thinking company.

- 👀 I’m interested in Software as I’ve always had a knack for solving problems and I feel that software does just that. I chose a career in software development because I find satisfaction in helping consumers, companies, and organizations find the solutions they need—from creating spreadsheets to life changing automation. Additionally, I have experience with a variety of programming languages, but specializing in python. For example, I've yet helped a relative build a busines data analytics and visualization. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Development @ Tshwane University Of Technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects.
